# surfs_up

## Overview
Our boss, W. Avy has asked us to analyze information about temperature trends so that he/she can open up a surf shop. The shop would be based in Hawaii, so the data we are analyzing will be tempurature data from Oahu. Particularly, W. Avy would like to know how sustainable the surf shop would be year-round. So, we will look at the months of June and December, which are seasonal opposites, for our analysis.

## Results
Below is the summary results for the month of June.

Some conclusions we can draw from this data is:

- The difference in the mean temperature for the two months is only about 4 degrees.
- The standard deviation of tempurates is slightly larger for December than it is for June, but by less than 1 degree.
- The range of temperatures is larger in December than in June. In December the temperatures swing 27 degrees while in June the temperatures only swing 21 degrees.
